**Art and Animation**
We implemented most of the graphical elements ourselves, including the design, creation and animation of the characters, user interface components, and background assets. Three freely available Unity assets were also used, including: a lightening bolt effect created by Digital Ruby (Jeff Johnson) [http://www.digitalruby.com/unity-plugins/], 2D UI buttons by JavedKahnme [javedkhanmailid@gmail.com], and a 2D Cartoon Parallax Background created by CPasteGame [www.artstation.com/cpastegame].
